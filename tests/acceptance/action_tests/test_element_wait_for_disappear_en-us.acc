As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the wait for element to disappear action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that I can wait for an element to disappear using the default 5 seconds
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I wait for "divWaitForInvisible" element to disappear
Then
    I do not see "divWaitForInvisible" element

Scenario 2 - Checking that I can wait for an element to disappear for a given number of seconds
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I wait for "divWaitForInvisible" element to disappear for 10 seconds
Then
    I do not see "divWaitForInvisible" element
