As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the wait for page to load action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that after clicking an image we can wait for page to load
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I click "imgSubmit" image
    And I wait for the page to load
Then
    I see "It Works!" title

Scenario 2 - Checking that after clicking an image we can wait for page to load for a given number of seconds
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I click "imgSubmit" image
    And I wait for the page to load for 10 seconds
Then
    I see "It Works!" title

Scenario 3 - Checking that after clicking an image we can wait for a really slow page to load
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I click "imgSubmitSlow" image
    And I wait for the page to load for 20 seconds
Then
    I see "It Works!" title
