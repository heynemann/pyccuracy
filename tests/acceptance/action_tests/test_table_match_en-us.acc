As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the table match action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can match the contents of a table
Given
    I go to "table_tests.htm?url=http%20%31%40blabla.com&other=whatever;other"
When
    #The Page is Loaded
Then
    I see "some" table as:
        | Name | Age | Sex  |
        | John | 28  | Male |
        | Paul | 30  | Male |
