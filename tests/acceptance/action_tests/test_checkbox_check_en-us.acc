As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the check checkbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a given checkbox gets checked
Given
	I go to "checkbox_tests.htm"
When
	I check the "chkUnchecked" checkbox
	And I check the "chkUnchecked2" checkbox
Then
	I see the "chkUnchecked" checkbox is checked
	And I see the "chkUnchecked2" checkbox is checked
