As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see link action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page link is there
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I do not see "invisibleLink1" link
	And I do not see "invisibleLink2" link
	And I do not see "invisibleLink3" link
	And I do not see "invisibleLink4" link
	And I do not see "invisibleLink5" link
