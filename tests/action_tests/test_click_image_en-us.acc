As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the click image action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can click an image by name
Given
    I go to "image_tests.htm"
When
    I click "imgChangeTitle" image
Then
    I see "different title" title
    
Scenario 2 - Checking that we can click an image by id
Given
    I go to "image_tests.htm"
When
    I click "imgChangeTitle2" image
Then
    I see "different title 2" title
